# Lab-09-back-end

**Author**: Jeff Borda and Evan Slaton
**Version**: 2.0.0

## Overview
When a user entered a city our server returned information from 5 API stored in the database if the information existed and was current. If the information wasn't in the database or was stale, our server requested new information from the 5 APIs.

## Getting Started
Assuming that the user has Postgres and node installed on their machine, They must first clone the repo, create the tables in psql, get API keys from each of the 5 APIs, npm i all the packages that are required, and run nodemon.

## Architecture
We used JavaScript, jQuery and SQL

## Change Log
We incorporated the meetup API, then the trails API, then debugged as needed

## Credits and Collaborations
Jeff and Evan did the bulk of the work with help from the instructors and TAs
